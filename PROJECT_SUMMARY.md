## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Agent Flow
```
User Input → Understanding Agent (Intent Recognition)
           → Safety Agent (Content Moderation)
           → Personalization Agent (Adaptive Response)
           → Lesson Agent (Curriculum Selection)
           → Feedback Agent (Pronunciation Coaching)
           → Combined Response
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Streaming pipeline** for sub-1.2s response target
- **Model pre-loading** on startup
- **Parallel processing** with asyncio support
- **Graceful degradation** with fallback responses

### Data Flow
```
Audio/Text Input → ASR/Text Processing → Agent Pipeline → 
Response Generation → TTS/Text Output → UI Update
```
